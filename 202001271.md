## Tool used: Pylint
## IDE: VSCode
## Repo used for analysis: https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode
The repo used for this task is by the user lincolnloop. It is a python project which is a QR code image generator.

Pylint is a widely used tool for analyzing Python code for potential errors, coding standards violations, and other issues. In this assignment, I will be using Pylint to analyze a repository of Python code and report on any potential issues found. This process helps in identifying and addressing code quality issues, and develop a deeper understanding of best practices for Python development.

### Code and Errors

#### Running pylint to analyze the folder qrcode which contains the py files for the project:
##### Terminal command used: "(base) dhruv_patel@Dhruvs-MacBook-Air python-qrcode-main % pylint qrcode"

#### 1. Error Eg : qrcode/main.py: 375:20: C0103: Variable name "c" doesn't conform to snake_case naming stvle (invalid-name)

<img width="971" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 47 07 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227495633-e19961e8-8452-4228-9ee1-059880f94566.png">

The pylint error "Variable name 'c' doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)" is an indication that the variable name 'c' does not follow the recommended naming convention for Python variables. In Python, the standard naming convention for variables is to use snake_case, which means that variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores.

In this specific case, the variable name 'c' does not adhere to this convention. To fix this issue, you should rename the variable to use snake_case, for example, by renaming 'c' to 'my_variable_name'. Adhering to naming conventions makes your code more readable and easier to understand, especially for other developers who may need to work with your code in the future.

#### 2. Error Eg : qrcode/image/styles/moduledrawers/pil.py:252:8:W0201: Attribute 'ROUND_LEFT' defined outside init (attribute-defined-outside-init)

<img width="1027" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 47 52 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227495810-b38d79bc-6a23-4702-98f1-6a4d8f93ea8f.png">

The pylint error "Attribute 'ROUND_LEFT' defined outside init (attribute-defined-outside-init)" occurs when a class attribute is defined outside of the __init__ method of a class. In Python, instance variables are usually defined within the __init__ method of a class. However, sometimes developers define class attributes outside the __init__ method.

In this specific case, the error is indicating that the class attribute 'ROUND_LEFT' has been defined outside of the __init__ method. This means that the attribute is being defined at the class level rather than at the instance level. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as the attribute will be shared across all instances of the class.

To fix this issue, you should define the 'ROUND_LEFT' attribute within the __init__ method or as an instance variable within a method. This ensures that the attribute is defined at the instance level and will be unique to each instance of the class. This will help to avoid any potential conflicts or unexpected behavior caused by sharing the attribute across all instances of the class.

#### 3. Error Eg : qrcode/image/base.p:110:0: W0223: Method 'save' is abstract in class 'BaseImage' but is not overridden (abstract-method)

<img width="1053" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 49 51 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227495948-03549171-1feb-428c-8308-48928844f3a8.png">

The pylint error "Method 'save' is abstract in class 'BaseImage' but is not overridden (abstract-method)" occurs when a method declared as abstract in a base class is not implemented in a subclass. In Python, an abstract method is a method declared in a base class, but without providing any implementation.

In this specific case, the error is indicating that the 'save' method declared as abstract in the 'BaseImage' class has not been implemented in a subclass that inherits from the 'BaseImage' class. This means that any subclass of 'BaseImage' should provide its own implementation of the 'save' method, but this has not been done.

To fix this issue, you need to implement the 'save' method in the subclass that inherits from 'BaseImage'. You can do this by providing a concrete implementation of the method in the subclass. This means that the method should have the same name and signature as the abstract method in the base class. Once you have implemented the method in the subclass, the pylint error should disappear, and the code should be able to run without issues.

#### 4. Error Eg : qrcode/tests/test_script.p:97:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)

<img width="1064" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 50 32 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227496115-85d8b258-c9f0-479d-adb4-40f61942dbbb.png">

The pylint error "Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)" occurs when a function or method is defined without a docstring. In Python, a docstring is a string literal that appears as the first statement in a function or method definition. The purpose of a docstring is to provide documentation for the function or method, describing its behavior, input parameters, output, and any exceptions that it may raise.

In this specific case, the error is indicating that a function or method is missing a docstring. To fix this issue, you need to add a docstring to the function or method. The docstring should provide a brief description of what the function or method does, what input parameters it expects, and what output it returns (if any). Additionally, you can include any relevant examples or usage notes to make the docstring more informative.

Adding docstrings to your functions and methods can help improve the readability of your code, making it easier for other developers to understand how your code works and how to use it. It is a best practice to include docstrings for all your functions and methods, and it can also help with code maintenance and debugging.

#### 5. Error Eg : qrcode/compat/pil.py:6:4: W0611: Unused Image imported from PIL (unused-import)

<img width="1056" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 50 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227496319-13fc3995-bc43-400b-ab4f-626b9d76c1f9.png">

The pylint error "Unused Image imported from PIL (unused-import)" occurs when a module or package is imported but not used in the code. In this specific case, the error is indicating that the 'Image' module has been imported from the 'PIL' package but not used in the code.

To fix this issue, you can either remove the import statement if it is not needed, or you can use the module in the code if it is required. If the module is not used in the current code, but it might be used in future updates, you can comment out the import statement to make the code more maintainable.

Importing unused modules in your code can increase the complexity of the code and make it harder to read and understand. Additionally, it can also impact the performance of your code, as Python will need to load and parse the module even if it is not used. Therefore, it is a best practice to only import the modules that are needed in your code, and to remove any unused imports to keep the code clean and efficient.

#### 6. Error Eg : qrcode/util.py: 499:0: R0914: Too many local variables (21/15) (too-many-locals)

<img width="1050" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 51 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227496475-719d53e4-18b2-4db1-b153-e03a4097e610.png">

The pylint error "Too many local variables (21/15) (too-many-locals)" occurs when a function or method has too many local variables. In Python, a local variable is a variable that is defined within a function or method and is only accessible within that function or method.

It is generally considered best practice to limit the number of local variables in a function or method to make the code more readable and maintainable.

To fix this issue, you can refactor the code to reduce the number of local variables in the function or method. One way to do this is to extract some of the local variables into separate functions or methods, or use them as class-level variables instead of function-level variables. Additionally, you can consider breaking down the function or method into smaller, more manageable parts, each with fewer local variables.

Reducing the number of local variables in your code can make it easier to read and understand, as well as improving performance and reducing the potential for bugs. Therefore, it is a best practice to keep the number of local variables in a function or method to a minimum and to refactor the code as needed to maintain this limit.

#### 7. Error Eg : qrcode/util.py:278:4: W0621: Redefining name 'lost_point' from outer scope (line 188) (redefined-outer-name)

<img width="1063" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 51 28 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227496675-10afdbff-609c-462d-902a-3f4cd1a93a4e.png">

The pylint error "Redefining name 'lost_point' from outer scope (line 188) (redefined-outer-name)" occurs when a variable is redefined in a nested scope with the same name as a variable in an outer scope. In Python, a variable defined in an outer scope can be accessed and modified in a nested scope, but if a variable with the same name is defined in the nested scope, it will shadow or overwrite the outer variable. Overwriting or shadowing variables in nested scopes can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in your code, especially if the variable is used in both the outer and nested scopes.

To fix this issue, you can rename the variable in the nested scope to avoid overwriting the original variable in the outer scope. Alternatively, you can use a different variable name in the outer scope to avoid conflicts with the nested scope.

#### 8. Error Eg : qrcode/util.py:286:16: R0916: Too many boolean expressions in if statement (17/5) (too-many-boolean-expressions)

<img width="1056" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 54 18 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227496916-e8841e68-7365-4d90-9009-fdacd10ba82e.png">

The pylint error "Too many boolean expressions in if statement (17/5) (too-many-boolean-expressions)" occurs when there are too many boolean expressions (logical operators) used in a single if statement.
In this specific case, the error is indicating that the if statement has more than five boolean expressions, which can make the code difficult to read and understand, and can lead to potential bugs.

To fix this issue, you can refactor the code to break down the if statement into smaller, more manageable parts. You can use helper functions to group related boolean expressions or use boolean variables with descriptive names to make the code more readable.Additionally, you can use other control flow structures like for loops or while loops, instead of multiple boolean expressions to simplify complex conditional statements.

Reducing the number of boolean expressions in your code can make it easier to read, understand and maintain, as well as reducing the likelihood of bugs.

#### 9. Error Eg : qrcode/image/styles/moduledrawers/pil.py:264:12: W0212: Access to a protected member img of a client class (protected-access)

<img width="1056" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-24 at 2 54 18 PM copy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75672785/227497054-002b28e6-db7b-4a94-bbec-2b47d4bb4983.png">

The pylint error "Access to a protected member img of a client class (protected-access)" occurs when a member variable or method that is marked as protected in a class is accessed or modified from outside the class, often in a subclass or client class.
In Python, a member variable or method can be marked as protected by prefixing its name with a single underscore character (e.g., _img). This convention indicates that the member variable or method should not be accessed or modified from outside the class, except by subclasses or trusted client classes.

In this specific case, the error is indicating that a member variable named img which is marked as protected, is being accessed from a client class.

To fix this issue, you should review the code and verify whether accessing the protected member variable or method from outside the class is necessary. It is generally considered good practice to respect the access level of member variables and methods in a class, as it can help ensure that the class operates as intended and reduce the likelihood of unintended consequences or bugs.
